### Recommended Tools and Practices

* **Version Control:** [Git semantic version](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-semantic-version)
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  1. Use CI/CD tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
  2. Set up automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests) in the CI pipeline.
* **Configuration Management:**
  1. [One password](https://developer.1password.com/), [Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/what-is-vault), [Infisical](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/infisical).
  2. Ensure consistent environments across dev, staging, and production.
* **Monitoring and Logging**:
  1. Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic for real-time monitoring.
  2. Use logging tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or Splunk for centralized logging.
* **Access Control**:
  1. Implement strict access control policies.
  2. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage who can access and modify each environment.
